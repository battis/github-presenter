# github-presenter

Present a GitHub repo (or a selection of files from a repo) referenced by a particular commit. By default, this will select all the files that share a root-level subdirectory with files that were changed in the commit referenced (but this is user-modifiable when the script runs -- add additional files or remove pre-selected files).

[And example of the output is included in the repository.](https://github.com/battis/github-presenter/blob/master/github-presenter.pdf)
